This is reusable code for inserting an order into the orders list. Use `placeOrderInCorrectPosition(clientGame, newOrder)` where `clientGame` is a [ClientGame](https://www.warzone.com/wiki/Mod_API_Reference:ClientGame) and `newOrder` is a [GameOrder](https://www.warzone.com/wiki/Mod_API_Reference:GameOrder).

`newOrder` is added as the last order in the orders list for its phase, or as the last order in the orders list if the order can occur doing any phase.
