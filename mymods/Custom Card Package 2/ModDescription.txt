This mod adds more custom cards to the game.
New cards:
Reconnaissance+ - Reconnaissance Cards with customizable range
Trap - like Blockade Cards except the territory become neutral when an enemy captures it
Immobilize - prevents all army movement (including airlifts) to and from a territory that is next to or is one of yours
Recycle - sets the number armies on a territory to be the amount that was on it on the first turn and changes the owner to neutral. The armies that used to be on the territory get added to your income. Can only be played on one of your own territories
