This mod allows each X territories to be worth -Y Gold.
Commerce is automatically enabled if it hasn't been done so already with army cost multiplier at 1 and no building cities (in essence making it just like normal income).
Gold (the currency of commerce games) has to be used as that the only form of currency that mods can override.

Comes with a basic bonus overrider to reduce the risk of draws.
Use the BonusValue QuickOverrider for more flexibility or manually override bonus values (in the Armies section).
