This mod allows each X territories to be worth -Y Gold.
Commerce is has to enabled. To make Gold (the currency of commerce games) just like normal income, go to Armies, tick Commerce, untick Army Cost Multiplier and untick building Can Build Cities.
Comes with a basic bonus overrider to reduce the risk of draws.
Use the BonusValue QuickOverrider for more flexibility or manually override bonus values (in the Armies section).

Gold has to be used as that is currently the only form of currency that mods can override.
Commerce and not be force enabled by mods, I have tried.
