This mod swaps your territories with someone else's at the end of every turn. The chance of territories swapping is customizable. Territories with a special unit (like commanders or tanks) aren't swapped. Territories with a structure (like cities) aren't swapped either.
Do not use a high chance of territories swapping if structures or special units aren't enabled otherwise the game may be infinitely long.
