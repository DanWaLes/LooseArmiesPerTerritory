This mod is like Swap Territories however structures (such as cities) are not swapped and the chance of territories swapping is decided for each territory instead of at the start of the turn for a fixed number of territories. And all player-owned territories have a chance of swapping.
Do not use a high chance of territories swapping if structures or special units aren't enabled otherwise the game may be infinitely long.
