This mod allows card pieces to be earned by each player without the need for capturing territories. Card pieces are given at the end of every X turns, starting on the first.
Only takes affect on cards that have been enabled in the Cards settings.
Note that you should change the "minimum pieces awarded per turn" for each affected card to 0 and adjust the "number of card pieces you get per turn" accordingly.
